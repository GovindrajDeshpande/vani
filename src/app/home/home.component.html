    <h3>Aims and Objectives of the Workshop :</h3>
    <p>The aim of this workshop is to give the
        participants a broad overview of research
        activities with special emphasis on reference
        management tools and their usefulness in
        organizing and managing research literature.
        Use of reference management tools Such as
        Mendeley, Zotero, will be helpful in creating &
        organizing bibliographies, construct
        references while writing research,
        collaborating and discovering new research.
        The advanced features of these tools help in
        automatic insertion of error free standard references and bibliographies through plugins, thereby saving the time, energy & efforts
        of research scholars.</p>

            Development cell and well established
            mechanism through which all R&D activities
            are promoted, encouraged and appraised
            .The R&D cell implements activities such as
            basic research, establishing centers of
